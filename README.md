This is Benjamin Reese's repo for assignment06
The first few exercises are analytical in nature and do not incude much coding. They calculate mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error, and a series of confusion matrices and model quality indicators for both binary and multiclass classification data tables. After that, I provide an analytical response to questions about random guessing and discuss the role of context in assessing the quality of our predictions. Finally, 5 includes quite a lot of code designed to create predictions of marble color based only on the knowledge of their size. For this, you will need to create a data folder in your working directory and place the marbles.csv file from canvas in it for the code to run. After that, you will only need to require the proper packages and all of the code should run. The code first splits the data into training and test data, with 20% reserved for testing. Then I discuss an intuitve/mental model of color prediction based on a barplot and a simple count of marbles of each size and color. From this, I derive conditional probabilities to better inform my prediction. I then create a simple function, color_prediction(), that takes an input of sizes and returns color predictions based entirely on the size the marble, big or small. I input our reserved testing data into this function in order to generate color predictions. The code then creates a second function, confusion_matrix(), designed to generate confusion matrices and calculate accuracy. Using the predictions generated by color_prediction(), I create a confusion matrix with the predicted data and the real colors from the reserved test data. The accuracy is predicted at .76. The last portion of code uses (tidymodels) to estimate a regression tree/CART model which will predict the color of marbles, using the training data and then applying the model to the testing data. The code also creates and plots a decision tree and creates a confusion matrix with the real color values from the test data and the predicted values derived from the CART model. The accuracy is the same as before, .76. I end the assignment by discussing why this is the case. This is the case because the size of a marble is such a meaningful predictor of a marble's color, and, in this simple case, we could figure this out from a simple plot while the model more strongly confirms our results.
